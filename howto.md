### Initial Software

#### OS: OpenWRT
https://openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi or https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/ -> https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/18.06.4/targets/brcm2708/bcm2708/ -> https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/18.06.4/targets/brcm2708/bcm2708/openwrt-18.06.4-brcm2708-bcm2708-rpi-ext4-factory.img.gz or https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/18.06.4/targets/brcm2708/bcm2710/openwrt-18.06.4-brcm2708-bcm2710-rpi-3-ext4-factory.img.gz

* Have in mind:

```
What is the difference between the different image formats?

    a factory image is one built for the bootloader flasher or stock software flasher
    a sysupgrade image (previously named trx image) is designed to be flashed from within openwrt itself
